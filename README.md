# BoomBot
## Background:
    In the Bellingham subreddit, people often post about a "boom" they heard. This occurs often enough that there is an unspoken challenge to be the first person to comment on the thread and call for a reset of the imaginary "boom counter".
    I needed a project to refresh my Python skills so I decided to take on the challenge of actually implementing the boom counter with this bot.

## Intent:
    This is just a joke project and only for fun. I doubt it will be well-received on the Bellingham subreddit. I am implementing this project with the following goals in mind:
    
    1. Brush up on my Python knowledge
    2. Play with Reddit's API
    3. Practice building a program from start to finish, from scratch (as much as you can with python anyway)
    4. Pick a design pattern to follow for the project
    5. Have fun displaying data for users to see
    6. Practice web interfaces

## Plan:

    I plan to first grab as much data as I can from Reddit from past "boom" posts. Reddit will only dish out 1000 posts worth of data, so i'll just work with that to start and continue logging future posts going forward.
    The data that I obtain will be displayed on a "Boom Dashboard" that users can go to view various data that has to do with boom posts in Bellingham.
    Each time a boom post is made, the bot will reply to the post and say something like:
    "The Boom counter has been reset! It's been 69 days since the last boom!"
